    <p>Iliotibial band (ITB) is a tendon running from hip to knee, susceptible to irritation.</p>
    <p>ITBS occurs when the ITB becomes irritated or swollen from rubbing against hip or knee bones.</p>
    <p>ITBS can affect one or both legs, termed bilateral ITBS.</p>
    <p>Athletes like basketball players, cyclists, runners, and soccer players are prone to ITBS.</p>
    <p>Risk factors include bowed legs, leg length discrepancy, knee arthritis, and certain movement patterns.</p>
