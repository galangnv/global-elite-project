    <p>An abdominal muscle strain, also known as a pulled stomach muscle, occurs when muscles in the stomach are torn or overly stretched.</p>
    <p>Abdominal muscles support the trunk, hold organs in place, and aid movement.</p>
    <p>Groups of abdominal muscles include oblique muscles, rectus abdominis muscles, and transversus abdominis muscles.</p>
    <p>Abdominal muscle strains can affect any abdominal muscle, including the left side, right side, lower abdomen, or upper abdomen.</p>
