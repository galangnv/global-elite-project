# Summary of Expenses

Our team utilized [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), a subset of the Google Cloud Platform, to serve our application. This included hosting, database, and IAM. It's intuitivity allowed us to stand up our backend and get it working with the frontend very quickly. In terms of expenses, we didn't have to pay anything because they have a very generous [Spark Plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing).

    In short the Spark Plan is completely free to get your app started. Once you complete development and go live, it will still be free until you hit a certain threshold of users on your site or data being stored. You then transition to the Blaze Plan, which is a pay as you go option that scales in parallel with your websites performance.

Since the backend was really the only financial worry, we ended up not spending a dime on our project. Our 3D model was a free open source model, our UI was Angulars free Material Library, and all of our backend was free as mentioned before. That is the beauty of our field really.
