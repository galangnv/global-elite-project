# Self Assessments

### Aiden Huff

I am an electrical engineering major with an MBA. This meant that most of my input into this project was not directly related to the development of the application. I did help here and there when extra scripting help was needed. My primary role involved conducting extensive research on several key aspects. Firstly, I focused on investigating the legal and ethical considerations surrounding our mobile application, particularly concerning health information and user privacy. This involved studying regulations related to medical apps and data protection to ensure our product adhered to all relevant standards. Additionally, I delved into detailed research on the human muscular system, gathering comprehensive information on muscle anatomy, function, and common rehabilitation techniques. This involved synthesizing complex medical knowledge into user-friendly content for our app. Through this process, I deepened my understanding of legal frameworks surrounding health technology and honed my ability to distill intricate medical concepts into accessible information. Researching the muscles required meticulous attention to detail and the ability to sift through vast amounts of data to pinpoint relevant and actionable insights for our app's users. I developed competencies in data analysis, critical thinking, and effective communication of technical information to diverse audiences.
 
My successes in this project included creating a robust foundation of accurate and practical information for our app's development. By understanding legal and ethical considerations early on, we could design the app with built-in safeguards and compliance measures. Most of these safeguards will be implemented as we further develop the application. However, obstacles emerged during the research phase, particularly in navigating complex medical literature and translating it into layman's terms. Ensuring the accuracy and relevance of our content posed challenges, but by doing extensive research, I overcame these hurdles to create a valuable resource for users seeking personalized muscle care and rehabilitation guidance. Another challenge we faced was the implementation of the 3D model. I was not originally assigned this task but once we realized the extent of the work needed, we all helped where we could. We ended up not being able to implement all that we wanted to with the 3D model. This mostly came down to timing issues. It took us longer than anticipated to get the 3D model working correctly. This meant that we could not implement all the features we wanted to before the expo."

### Christian Galang

In this project, my individual contribution was pivotal in shaping the informative and user-friendly aspects of our application, Musclepedia. My primary responsibilities encompassed crafting detailed content pages aimed at providing essential information on pain relief techniques and causes for various body parts. This involved extensive research and meticulous attention to detail to ensure clarity and relevance for our users. Additionally, I played a significant role in frontend development, where I designed and implemented interactive elements such as buttons and user interface components. By applying my skills in content creation and frontend development, I contributed to enhancing the app's usability and aesthetic appeal, thereby fostering a seamless experience for users navigating through treatment options and engaging with the 3D model.

Throughout this process, I learned valuable lessons about effective content strategy and UI/UX design, building competencies in research, content creation, and frontend development. However, one obstacle I encountered was my limited experience with Angular, the framework we utilized for frontend development. Overcoming this obstacle required additional time and effort spent learning Angular's intricacies, which impacted the project timeline. Additionally, the time constraint posed another challenge, necessitating efficient time management and prioritization of tasks to meet deadlines. Despite these obstacles, my dedication to delivering high-quality content and frontend features was instrumental in shaping Musclepedia into a comprehensive and user-friendly platform.

### Tyler Swick

My individual contribution to the project was mainly assisting in implementing the 3D model into our product. This took up most of my time on the technical side. I would say my skills were not very applicable from my initial assessment in the Fall but I was able to learn many new things and build my knowledge in angular. I was able to capitalize on my previous typescript experience and learn how to incorporate three.js.

Through this experience, I was also able to garner new experience using angular and firebase as well. Firebase was entirely new to me and I plan to continue using it in future hobby projects. In the capstone project, one big obstacle for me was converting the innately javascript functionality three.js into typescript code. This was hard to overcome but with the help of my team, I was able to accomplish this feat. A big success was implementing this code but also watching our app come together with login functionalities and exercise advice!
