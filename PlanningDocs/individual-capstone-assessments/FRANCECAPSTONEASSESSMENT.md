## Individual Capstone Assessment
### Christian France


Our senior design project will be an app that allows users to obtain information on how to
stretch a sore area of the body by selecting a muscle group from a 3-d visual. America is recognized as an
unhealthy, obese nation, and we are aiming to assist those in search of living a healthier lifestyle. With
the Covid pandemic came a surge of people focused on fitness, and we want to assist them in the phase
of recovery from a good workout. All from their mobile device or desktop.

As I am an incoming 5th year Computer Science major, I have been through the ringer of CS
classes. Data Structures, Programming Languages, Discrete Structures, Database Design, and more.
These classes provided me with the core understanding of software development and the tools needed
to successfully bring a product to fruition. Being able to learn the fundamentals and then apply those in
my Co-op experiences has built me into a strong developer and scholar.

For these stated Co-ops, I had the opportunity to work at two companies here in Cincinnati. My
first two rotations were at Cincinnati Childrens Hospital and Medical Center as a Full-Stack developer. It
was here that I had my first taste of real web development, as I created an app for use in the NICU. My
last two rotations were with Medpace, Inc. My team here showed me what it was like to work on a
bigger team on existing and new software for a large corporation. My favorite team I got to work on was
the Finance team, developing and supporting internally built financial applications. Through Medpace, I
also gained a better understanding of how a larger company is structured and operates, which grew my
interest in the intersection of business and tech.

I am extremely motivated on this project because of my history in the development of
healthcare and medicine apps. I have a good deal of experience and interest in the field in general. I also
believe we have a solid team of motivated, hard-working, and intelligent scholars collaborating on this
project which will be hugely beneficial in executing this project. We have a variety of backgrounds and
majors giving us the advantage of diversity in creative thinking.

For preliminary approach to product design, it is always helpful to start with the goals of the app.
What do we want our end users to get out of it? From here we can establish what components we will
need for the app and break it up even more into individual tasks to develop. I expect to have a fully
working app by the end of the capstone duration. A smooth, simple, yet beautiful app that will benefit
anyone who picks it up. UI/UX has been an expanding field and I expect us to explore this greatly in the
design process of our app. For self-evaluation, I will of course put in the work and ensure that I am doing
my part. However, it will be my teammates that will be the judge of my effort as one cannot prove their
worth without the word of another.
