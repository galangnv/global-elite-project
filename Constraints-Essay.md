# Constraint Essay

Through the creation of our application we may face various challenges and constraints. These could have negative effects on the production of the app because it may extend development time or change the course of what we originally envisioned for the app. Here are some of the constraints we may face.

### Legal Issues
 Our project could possibly face legal issues because we are not health professionals, yet we are giving information and instructions regarding physical wellness. Many people need to obtain a license to provide this type of coaching, but none of us have this license.

 Another legal issue we may face, is an end-user license agreement. Many applications have this in place to protect themselves from possible lawsuits in the event the user is negatively effected by the app somehow.

 ### Security
 Since our application may contain user health information, it needs to be secure to protect this information. Health data is one of the biggest targets in cyber attacks today. There is also the new European GDPR compliance, which governs the way we must process and store user data.
 
 Similarly, we must adhere to HIPAA which is a similar compliance law in the US which says we must follow certain standards to better protect user health data.

 ### Ethical
 When it comes to health and fitness, many companies have to be inclusive to all body types and genders to avoid negative moral impact on the customers. People may be hurt if they feel attacked by some portion of the fitness information. We will make sure to create a safe space for all body types and genders.
